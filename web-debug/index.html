    <!-- In the previous we were setting the inline style of the target element to be disply:none; which was
     okay it was working fine , but the actually it depends on the requirement whether we want to see the 
    target element to be visible first then we want to toggle the visibility -->

    <!-- Corrected One -->
    <!-- I just changed the target element to be  visible first so i changed the inline style of the
    target element to display:block; -->
