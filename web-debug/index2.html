  <!-- Explanation -->
  <!-- The code that we just had one div now it was covering 50% width of the viewport
and there was a margin of auto it was centering the div in the horizontal direction not 
vertically because height of the div from the top of the visible viewport was neglible so 
it will not be able to center itself vertically -->

  <!-- Corrected code -->
  <!-- Just added a outer div which taking a height of 100vh which is viewport height and now it can 
center the div inside the outerdiv  -->
